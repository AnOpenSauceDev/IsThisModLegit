# Is This Mod Legit?

[Modrinth Link](https://modrinth.com/mod/is-this-mod-legit) (as of this commit, not yet approved)

A pretty tiny mod that checks the hashes of every mod in your mods folder against Modrinth to see if the mod you're using is tamper-free.

Works as long **as you have less than 300 _individual (.jar file)_ mods** (because you'll get rate-limited going past that.)

Due to this mod using the Modrinth API, this will fail checks on binaries from CurseForge/Github that aren't identical to what's on Modrinth.

This mod is very much in its infancy, with quite a bit of work still to go.
